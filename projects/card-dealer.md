summary: "A basic coding project that dealt cards"
---

This is a basic coding project that I made in my spare time with the help of a friend when I was messing around with Java for the first time, before I eventually decided to pursue computer science as a major. It was meant to be a game of Go Fish, but I couldn't figure out some coding issues at the time, and settled for creating just the code for dealing cards. Unfortunately, I lost the code when I was upgrading my laptop's storage.

Each card was an array that consisted of what suit it was (hearts, diamonds, spades, or clubs), as well as its number (1 to 13). The code would generate 4 sets of 13, then randomly insert them into the array that the deck consisted of.  Before dealing, you needed to do an input which would be the total number of players and how many cards each player would have. It would then create as many arrays as there were players, and pop the cards off of the deck to each of these arrays in order until each player had the specified amount of cards. You could then type the input "hand", where it would then give you the types of cards you had in your hand.

From this, I learned how to code for what was basically the first time in Java, and it gave me experience in trying to wrap my head around how code works and how to approach problems when I didn't necessarily know how to implement what I wanted.
