##More tools, more things to learn 

	ESLint is an analysis tool for identifying various potential problems, ranging from syntax errors, code style violations, formatting issues, and bugs, and it is the latest tool that we’ve been instructed to use in our ICS 314 software engineering course. Implementing it in IntelliJ, the IDE that we have begun using, was a hassle, but so far it seems to be worth it. 

It identifies several problems and instructs us to correct our code to stick to coding standard guidelines, which involve changing from double quotation marks to single quotation marks, adjusting the spaces between our code, and other such things. 

##Readability = coordination

	Although some would say that these things are largely irrelevant compared to the actual content of the code (...well, I mean, they’re not exactly wrong), it's still a useful tool for a bunch of students still learning code. It highlights problems that could affect the readability and structure of our code, and considering how much our future jobs will likely have us collaborating with other coders, it's a critical skill for us to learn now. 

Otherwise, I imagine how much pain everyone working with you will end up going through trying to decipher what exactly is going on within the code, reducing efficiency and coordination. Better to learn that lesson sooner rather than later when it’s more critical, I guess. 

##Thoughts

	Therefore, these coding standards, despite being somewhat painful to see within your code (because let’s be real, it is *stressful* seeing that many errors pop up), are entirely worth the effort to eventually have nice, easily understandable and readable code. 

One of my professors in ICS 212 has even in fact been trying his best to hammer this lesson into us, so the fact that so much emphasis is placed on this probably means that it’s definitely worth the effort to learn. It can only help, after all. 

Plus, it makes your code look prettier. Who doesn’t like pretty code?
