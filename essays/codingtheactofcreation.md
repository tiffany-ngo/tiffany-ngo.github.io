## Creation & Coding

Creation is skill that comes in a multitude of flavors, ranging from painting, to woodworking, to architecture. The idea of creating something, and breathing life into something that others will consume and use and entertain themselves with is an appealing idea to many, as it is basically a way of leaving one's legacy on the world. 

I guess in my case, my form of creation of interest is coding. It started when I first discovered 'mods' in the video game Minecraft, and I realized how fun it was to modify and alter the game files to create an experience that was more tailored to my liking. This appreciation of modding is what led to an interest in coding in video games, as I would be able to create more projects that others would see and possibly use. Although I'm not sure if video game design is what I want to actively pursue as a career or if I'd rather focus on something else, it's still a lovely reminder of why I want to do this.

## Software engineering, a stepping stone

Software engineering is a ways of practicing this creation of code. Designing websites and figuring out how to best implement it and approach any problems that I encounter in my code is a means of preparing me for my future career. There's something just so satisfying about seeing something that I've spent working on and coding for the past hours or days or weeks come to life, and code is no different. I hope to learn how to collaborate with others in code, something we seem to be focusing on quite a bit in class so far, and see how to better work together with others and communicate when it comes to the development of code.
