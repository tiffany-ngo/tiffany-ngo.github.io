## Introduction

AI is a new emerging tool that is continously being developed and updated, and it will simply continue to grow. It certainly isn't going anywhere, and its abililty to provide (near) accurate solutions and answers to any of your problems, or at the very least provide a starting point in figuring it out, certainly hasn't gone unnoticed by students. Students are notorious for figuring out the easiest, quickest, and simplest way of figuring out their homework, and AI is no exception, leaving schools unsure of their stances and approach to handling this usage of AI.

For software engineering, AI provides students with starting points for basic code, allowing them a quick way of figuring out what exactly is wrong with their code. What used to take hours of frustration of guessing and double-checking can usually be solved relatively easy by running your code through an AI tool within a few minutes. ChatGPT for example, is a tool that I've used to provide a solution to something that was frustrating me. 

## Personal Experience with AI

Within ICS 314, there are multiple types of assessments to further our learning, and I will be going over my usage of AI with them:

- Experience WODs: Generally, due to the videos provided by the professor within the WODs, there was no need to use AI to figure out what's wrong, since the video and text explanations are usually enough to figure it out from there. However, sometimes the explanations are outdated and a quick Google search isn't enough to solve it, leaving it necessary to use AI to figure out a solution. I would simply copy the code and ask what was wrong with the specific line. This was useful for figuring out why something wasn't working in a timely manner.

- In-class Practice WODs: There are also in-class WODs, but usually a solution is provided afterwards by the TA, so AI usage is unnecessary. Not to mention, the point of the in-class practice WOD is to see what we can do from memory, as well as practice our communication with other people, so using AI would defeat the purpose of it. 

- In-class WODs: The in-class WODs served as a test, and so the thought of being caught and given a 0 at best served as a good enough deterrent from using AI.

- Essays: For the essays, I would enter the assignment instructions to receive a framework of how I should approach the essay, then write the paper on my own from there. The hardest part of an essay is getting started, so this gives me some ideas of what I should write and how to structure it.

- Final Project: The final project basically was a culmination of our learning in the class, and we've had enough practice with the WODs that we could basically take from the WODs we did and use it as a basis for our framework, not to mention we could consult the instructions for the WODs if there was some sort of issue that came up. Therefore, there never really was a reason to use AI for the final project. We had all the info we needed.

- Learning a Concept/Tutorial: The videos and instructions on the WODs and the class website was usually enough to get a good enough idea of what exactly it is that we're learning, but sometimes the way it's phrased or explained is difficult for me to wrap my head around. If Wikipedia also didn't help, ChatGPT was a go-to to get a basic summary of what it was that we were trying to learn/accomplish. I would just ask it to give me a summary of the topic.

- Answering a Question in Class or in Discord: I don't answer questions in class or Discord (it's scary), so there was never a reason to use AI for it either.

- Asking or Answering a Smart-Question: I don't answer smart-questions because I don't think my understanding is good enough for me to try (not to mention in case I'm wrong and I look dumb in front of everyone and talking to people is scary), so I don't use AI for that. As for asking a smart-question, I don't ask those for the same reason (in case I look dumb and it's scary), so AI isn't necessary either. 

- Coding Example: As for these, generally, there are plenty of examples given in the video or through a TA, so I don't need to use AI for coding examples.

- Explaining Code: I don't think I've ever needed to explain my code to anyone ever in this class. If it works it works, you know? So AI isn't used here.

- Writing Code: If I needed to use AI to write code for me, then I would use it in a similar way to how I use it for essays. I'd use it to get a general idea and for it to provide my structure to get started, then I'd code from scratch on my own. However, in this particular class, there's always a helpful example to get us started, not to mention a video to reference, so it's been largely unnecessary to use.

- Documenting Code: If I wrote the code, then I know what's going on with it and can document it well enough myself, so I've never bothered with AI for this as it didn't seem worth the effort. I doubt it'd be able to document it accurately anyway.

- Quality Assurance: This is probably the most I use AI for. It saves me so much time from having to double check everything when I have no clue what's going on when sometimes it's just a matter of me not including a semicolon or not including a line because I deleted it by accident or made a typo at some point. I would simply copy the code and ask if it could figure out what was wrong, and generally it gives me something. This is especially useful if ESlint couldn't provide me with a solution that made sense.

- Other Uses in ICS 314 Not Listed: Sometimes it's just fun asking the AI to make code for random little projects by asking it to create code for a shopping list maker or for a site that counts coins or something. It's just neat seeing it try it's best and it gives me a somewhat better idea of how you'd put something like it together.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding

Honestly, AI probably has a detrimental effect on my learning experience. It's all too easy to get into the habit of using it solve anything that poses me even the slightest issue, resulting in taking away the time you'd take problem-solving in a step-by-step fashion to figure out what's wrong. This can be done now, since the material being learned is relatively simple, but it probably won't be the most accurate when it comes to more complex projects, and my ability to problem-solved would be hindered due to my reliance on it. That's an issue for future me though.

However, there is something to say for its ability to condense important information and bits of knowledge into an easily presentable and readable way. Sometimes things take hours to figure out, and not all of that time wasted is useful, so it can be useful to have a tool that can solve more minor problems in moments, and save me time that can be spent figuring out other things. 

## Practical Applications

Outside of ICS 314, AI can definitely be helpful in the organization and management of real-world projects. Although I imagine it's usefulness is decreased when it comes to large-scale, complicated stuff, it can be used to help organize and manage groups of people by providing you with an idea of how to go about certain tasks and collaborative events. As long as it's used as a tool and a reference that you can build on instead of expecting it to give you an immediate answer, it is useful for all manners of tasks.

## Challenges and Opportunities

AI, despite its uses, is unreliable, especially with free ones such as ChatGPT. There have been multiple times that its given me a variation of the same exact wrong response, or misinterpreted what I've said, or ignored requests and information that I've typed into my prompt. It cannot be relied on without some form of fact checking to ensure that the info it's given you is not wrong in some way or form. 

Despite this, it does serve its purpose more often than not, and so it is possible for it to be used in a classroom setting as a tool and learning experience within the course, especially one dedicated specifically towards AI usage. Its important after all to discuss ramifications of its use in real-world applications and the such in a classroom setting.

## Comparative Analysis

Traditional learning methods are simply better than AI. Usage of AI can quickly become an overeliance, hindering your ability to actually retain the information that you're trying to learn. It can be all too easy to use it to figure out a solution, go "aha!", act as if you've learned it in a meaningful way, then promptly forget about what you learned a week later. Traditional learning methods prevent this by ensuring that its repeated and hammered into your brain. However, it can be said that in classroom settings, it can be difficult to get the attention you need from your professor or TA with so many other students, making it difficult when you need help. AI provides a means of getting that help and enhancing your learning, as long as you appraoch it with the right mindset.

## Future Considerations

It's future role is one of a tool, a very advanced tool that can provide you with the answers and knowledge you seek in a way thats easily accessible by anyone with an internet connection. How to properly use it just needs to be taught, and it is an important note that it should be used with careful consideration of the sources that its analyzing from. There are ethical concerns that need to be considered, after all.

## Conclusion

Overall, AI is a useful tool that's provided me multiple times with the answers I seek, and has supplemented my learning by giving me access to information that would otherwise take me absolutely forever to figure out on my own. As long as I make sure that I'm actually and don't over rely on it, it does its job well. It would be nice to be able to use the tool more freely without having to feel like I'm committing a crime, considering how often other courses specify that use of AI is strictly forbidden. It is after all, just a tool, and whether you abuse it is up to you.
